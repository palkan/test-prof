# RSpecDissect

Do you know how much time you spend in `before` hooks? Or memoization helpers such as `let`? Usually, the most of the whole test suite time.

_RSpecDissect_ provides this kind of information and also shows you the worst example groups. The main purpose of RSpecDissect is to identify these slow groups and refactor them using [`before_all`](https://github.com/palkan/test-prof/tree/master/guides/before_all.md) or [`let_it_be`](https://github.com/palkan/test-prof/tree/master/guides/let_it_be.md) recipes.

Example output:

```sh
[TEST PROF INFO] RSpecDissect enabled

Total time: 25:14.870
Total `before(:each)` time: 14:36.482
Total `let` time: 19:20.259

## Instructions

RSpecDissect can only be used with RSpec (which is clear from the name).

To activate RSpecDissect use `RD` environment variable:

```sh
RD=1 rspec ...
```

You can also specify the number of top slow groups through `RD_TOP` variable:

```sh
RD=1 RD_TOP=10 rspec ...
```
